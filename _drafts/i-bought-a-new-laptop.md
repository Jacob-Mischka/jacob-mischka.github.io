I've never had a new laptop before. I was in college when I got my first laptop, a used Dell ???. A rugged business laptop. It was heavy and slow but it did the job. I've always had a desktop, so I never needed a particularly good notebook. The Dell was enough to browse the web and edit text files for college classes, and that's all I needed.

Before too long, however, the hinges on the display began to die. I had to keep the display at a 90 degree angle or gravity would take control. Once I got sick of this, I purchased a laptop from a classmate. It was nearly new, but it was a terrible piece of hardware. The CPU was far from a workhorse, its touchpad worked on every other boot (?), and its wireless card simply would not work on WPA2 networks without disconnecting before 5 minutes. It was miserable to use, but hey at least it had a touchscreen!!

About a year and a half later I bought my then-just-former roommate's laptop. It was by no means a bad laptop, it had 8GB of memory and an i5. Certainly enough to do anything I needed from it. It was beginning to show its age however, its 5 year old GPU and 17-inch 1600x900 display resulted in a heavy and large 7.5 pound beast. After almost a year of that and several weeks of casual searching for a replacement, I finally decided it was time for me to get my own brand new laptop.

This was last week, and I decided on an [Acer Aspire E 15 E5-574G-52QU][1]. Here are my thoughts on it after a few days.
