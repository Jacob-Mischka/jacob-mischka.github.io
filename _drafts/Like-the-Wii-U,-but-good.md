title: Like the Wii U, but good

Like the rest of the world, I've been playing Fallout 4. The game itself is very good, it's improved pretty much everything from 3, which I admittedly didn't like that much.

Where Fallout 3 felt like an RPG with guns, 4 actually feels like a shooter with RPG and adventure elements. Well, in all but one respect, the settlement builder minigame they've been touting so much. While it certainly looks powerful, and I can now confirm it to be, I still have zero interest in using it. I really hope I'm not further required to do so.

Arguably my favorite addition to the new installment is the [Pip Boy mobile app][1]. It's unreasonably fun to use and still impresses me with how seamlessly it integrates with the game.
