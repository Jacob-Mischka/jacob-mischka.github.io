Today was the main nature day of our trip: a short hike in Ozark National Forest to [Whitaker's Point][whitakers-point]. After eating from the breakfast buffet at [The Filling Station][filling-station], we stopped at Subway and I picked up a ham and turkey sub to bring on the hike as lunch.

After an hour and a half drive on narrow and curvy country highways, and another 20 minutes on a steeply inclined and even narrower and curvier gravel road, we reached Whitaker's Point Trailhead where the sign informed us it's a 3.1 mile round-trip hike to the outcropping. We parked the car and headed onto the trail with our backpacks in tow, and I was soaking wet within minutes. It was very hot and I'm pretty out of shape.

Along the way, we crossed over several brooks, and about halfway to the Point we took a slight detour when we saw one of the brooks create a small waterfall. We jumped down the 8ish foot drop into a picturesque scene: the small waterfall creating a small pool flowing into a brook and the outcropping creating an expansive shelter, complete with campfire remnants and makeshift stone seats from previous campers. An extremely worthwhile detour.

Once we were back on the trail, we came across several vantage points.

I'm tired now so I'm just going to summarize the main events and come back tomorrow to fill them in
